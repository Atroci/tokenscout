# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Roadmap tracked in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md): the live-site `extract` package
(computed-style extraction, asset harvesting, animation capture) and the
type/spacing reducers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

First open-core release: the zero-dependency color layer, tested and CI-gated.

### Added

- Zero-dependency TypeScript design-token toolkit (ESM, Node 20+).
- Color module (`tokenscout/color`): CSS color parsing (`parseColor`, hex
  3/4/6/8 + `rgb()`/`rgba()` with gamut clamping), sRGB→CIELAB conversion
  (`rgbToLab`), ΔE76 distance (`deltaE76`), and perceptual color clustering via
  single-linkage union-find (`clusterColors`).
- Type-resolving package `exports` (`.` and `./color`), `sideEffects: false`,
  and a `prepack` build guard for safe publishing.
- Tooling: ESLint + Prettier, a 12-case `node:test` suite, GitHub Actions CI
  (lint → typecheck → build → test → prod-dep audit).
- Project docs: `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `SECURITY`,
  `ROADMAP`, `ARCHITECTURE`, issue/PR templates.
